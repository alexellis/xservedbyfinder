Go

I have written the following Go code through trial & error and 'Googling'.

**Instructions:**

Using docker-compose:

* `docker-compose up`

Using `docker run`:

* Build the image `./build_docker.sh`
* Run the example `./run_docker.sh <num_requests> <url>`
 * If you do not pass a URL raspberrypi.org will be used by default.
